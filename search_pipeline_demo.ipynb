    "# Building a Search Pipeline That Understands What Users Want\n",
    "Whenever you try to find something on an e-commerce site, you don't search in natural language, because the way search engine result is not catered to our natural way of looking things. For example, we searched for *“comfortable running shoes under `$100`”* and the results will contain items costing more than `$200`, some of which are not running shoes, and ignore the comfort requirement. This happens because keyword search treats queries as disconnected terms instead of meaningful requests. It cannot infer that “comfortable” refers to cushioning and support or that “under `$100`” is a strict limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In such scenarios, you either move away from that platform or you think the product isn't available on the site. This leads to the Null Result Fallacy, they tend to show anything matching those keywords, any kind of shoe, where results are technically correct but practically irrelevant. This is where semantic search helps!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Semantic Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand semantic search let's think about you search for things in real life. When you ask a friend \"where can I find good coffee nearby?\", you're not looking for place with \"good coffee\" in their name. You're looking for coffee shops that serve quality coffee and are close to you. Your friend understands the meaning behind your question, not just the keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search applies similar idea. A model can recognize that “comfortable running shoes” relates to concepts like cushioning, support, and softness even if those words are not present. Semantic understanding is only part of the solution. You might expect the system to apply structured filters such as price, category, and availability. A Hybrid Search supports this by combining semantic vectors with strict filters in one retrieval process. Before we look at the structured filters, let's deep dive more into matching words vs vectors! \n",
    "\n",
    "### From Words to Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early days of search approaches, we used to match *words*, nowadays we switched to matching *vectors*. This is where embedding models come in. The reason is that traditional word embeddings, such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and GloVe, operate at the word level. They can tell you that \"dog\" and \"puppy\" are similar, but they struggle with understanding the full meaning of a sentence or phrase. When you search for \"comfortable running shoes,\" you need to understand the entire phrase as a unit, not just individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "New embedding models solve this by converting entire sentences or phrases into dense vector representations (embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning. These models are trained on millions of text pairs to understand that \"comfortable running shoes\" and \"cushioned athletic footwear\" mean essentially the same thing, even though they share no common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we will be using in this blog is `gemini-embedding-001`, Google's latest embedding model that converts text into 3072-dimensional vectors. Each dimension captures some aspect of meaning. When two pieces of text have similar meanings, their vectors will be close together. When they're different, the vectors will be far apart. This higher dimensionality allows for a more nuanced understanding of semantic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Milvus\n",
    "\n",
    "A search pipeline needs more than a vector index. It needs a database that supports vector search and structured filtering in one place. Milvus provides this by running vector similarity search with scalar filters such as price and category. It also performs pre filtering so that items outside constraints do not enter the vector search step. Helps improves accuracy and latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Semantic Search Needs Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Users often search with layered intent. A query like “wireless headphones with noise cancellation” implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* category: headphones\n",
    "* wireless capability\n",
    "* noise cancellation\n",
    "* expected price range\n",
    "* brand considerations\n",
    "* in stock items only\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional keyword search treats these as isolated words. Users expect a system that recognizes how these elements work together.\n",

    "In this blog, we have seen that the combination of semantic search and structured filtering can solve the traditional keyword search problem, which is too rigid, requiring exact word matches and manual synonym maintenance. Semantic search can bring more value if we combine structured filters, such as price ranges, stock status, or features, and we can achieve the best of both worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search landscape is evolving rapidly, and the combination of semantic search with structured filtering is becoming essential for modern applications. Whether you're building an e-commerce platform, a content discovery system, or an internal knowledge base, this approach gives you the flexibility and efficiency to deliver great search experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you found this valuable, I'd love to hear about your use cases and how you're implementing search in your applications. The future of search is intent-aware, and we're just getting started.\n"
